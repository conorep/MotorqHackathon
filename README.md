# Project Info

Author: Conor O'Brien
Assignment: Motorq Hackathon

This project was created in React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. 

React handles front end rendering and communicates with the MySQL database through interactions with Express. The project should allow a user to find a list of upcoming events and register for them, as well as provide an admin access to creating/deleting/altering events. 

I got as far as creating an unstyled frontend with routes for the pages I needed to complete. The landing page pulls events from the database, and the map page displays a map that should have plotted points of upcoming events that can be registered to. The rest of the site remains unfinished. 

The database itself has tables for users and events, as well as some views and a function associated with the means of retrieving data that I was hoping to implement in the time allotted.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
